# Keeping things stored at one place.

I currently work with finance, controlling, developing within financial reporting. I believe that the work environment today is scattered especially within my field of expertise. We have today an rapidly changing trend towards digitalization. The interpretation of this is that an accountant in the future cannot only be an accountant. Everone needs to be more: The growing digitalization puts higher empahsis on skills related to data and statistics, however one also needs the crucial knowledge of business and accounting. I see it a wide knowledge gap between datascientists and accountants/controllers. I personally strive to be both of these to be the part that fill the gap betweeen these different knowledges this to take better/faster/more efficient decisions.
